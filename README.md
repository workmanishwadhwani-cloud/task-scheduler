## 🗓️ Task Scheduler Web App

A simple and interactive **Task Scheduler** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to add tasks and schedule them using different **greedy scheduling algorithms** such as Priority-Based, Earliest Deadline First (EDF), and a combined Priority + Deadline approach.

This project is ideal for demonstrating **DSA concepts (Greedy Algorithms)** in a practical, visual way.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Task Scheduler Web App** helps users manage tasks by assigning priorities and deadlines. Once tasks are added, users can generate an optimized execution order using different scheduling strategies. The application visually displays how different algorithms affect task ordering, making it useful for learning and demonstrations.
